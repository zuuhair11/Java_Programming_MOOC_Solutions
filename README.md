# Java Programming MOOC Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the University of Helsinkiâ€™s massive open online course (MOOC) on Java programming. This course is designed to teach the basics of computer programming, algorithms, and object-oriented programming using Java. Below, you'll find details about the course and my progress through it.

## About the Course

The University of Helsinki's MOOC on programming is an updated version of their popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java. Note that this is a legacy course, meaning it is no longer possible to gain ECTS credits for completing it, and the content is no longer updated or maintained. However, it still provides a thorough introduction to programming with Java.

### Course Highlights:
- Learn basic computer programming, algorithms, and object-oriented programming with Java.
- Comprehensive materials and extensive programming exercises.
- Exercises tested using the automatic testing service, Test My Code.
- Industry-grade tooling from day one.
- No previous programming knowledge required.
- Identical in scope and material to the University of Helsinki's CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses.
