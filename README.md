# Java Programming MOOC Solutions

Welcome to my repository of solutions for the University of Helsinkiâ€™s massive open online course (MOOC) on Java programming. This course is designed to teach the basics of computer programming, algorithms, and object-oriented programming using Java. Below, you'll find details about the course and my progress through it.

## About the Course

The University of Helsinki's MOOC on programming is an updated version of their popular course Object-Oriented Programming with Java. Note that this is a legacy course, meaning it is no longer possible to gain ECTS credits for completing it, and the content is no longer updated or maintained. However, it still provides a thorough introduction to programming with Java.

### Course Highlights:
- Learn basic computer programming, algorithms, and object-oriented programming with Java.
- Comprehensive materials and extensive programming exercises.
- Exercises tested using the automatic testing service, Test My Code.
- Industry-grade tooling from day one.
- No previous programming knowledge required.
- Identical in scope and material to the University of Helsinki's CS1 Introduction to Programming and Advanced Programming courses.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into two parts:

### Java Programming I
1. **Part 1**: Introduction to Programming
2. **Part 2**: Variables, Calculations, and Input
3. **Part 3**: Conditional Statements and Control Flow
4. **Part 4**: Loops and Iteration
5. **Part 5**: Methods and Functional Decomposition
6. **Part 6**: Arrays and Lists
7. **Part 7**: Objects and Object-Oriented Programming

### Java Programming II
1. **Part 8**: Inheritance and Polymorphism
2. **Part 9**: Interfaces and Abstract Classes
3. **Part 10**: Error Handling and Exceptions
4. **Part 11**: Data Structures and Collections
5. **Part 12**: File I/O and Persistence
6. **Part 13**: Advanced Object-Oriented Programming
7. **Part 14**: Final Project and Wrap-Up

Each part includes a set of exercises that can take anywhere from 5 to 20 hours to complete, depending on your prior experience with computers and programming.


## How to Use This Repository

1. **Cloning the Repository**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zuuhair11/Java_Programming_MOOC_Solutions.git
    ```

2. **Navigating Through the Parts**: Each part is contained within its respective directory, and you can navigate through them to find the solutions to the exercises.

3. **Running the Code**: The solutions are written in Java, so you'll need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can compile and run the Java files using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or through the command line.
